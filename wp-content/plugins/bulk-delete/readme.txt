Thanks <a href="http://www.martincapodici.com">Martin Capodici</a> for providing the code to implement the "delete specific page" feature.

Thanks to [Time picker addon](http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/) JavaScript library, which the Plugin uses.

Thanks to [select2](https://select2.github.io/) JavaScript library, which the Plugin uses.

== Installation ==

The simplest way to install the plugin is to use the built-in automatic plugin installer. Go to plugins -> Add New and then enter the name of the plugin to automatically install it.

If for some reason the above method doesn't work then you can download the plugin as a zip file, extract it and then use your favorite FTP client and then upload the contents of the zip file to the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installing the Plugin, I just see a blank page. =

This can happen if you have huge number of posts and your server is very underpowered. Check your PHP error log to see if there are any errors and correct them. The most common problems are script timeout or running out of memory. Change your PHP.ini file and increase the script timeout and/or amount of memory used by PHP process. You can view the current values of these settings from the system info page which can be accessed by going to Bulk WP -> System Info.

In particular try to change the following settings

*   `max_execution_time = 600` - Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
*   `max_input_time = 30` - Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
*   `memory_limit = 256M` - Maximum amount of memory a script may consume

You can also try to disable different sections of the Plugin, if you have huge number of posts.

= How do I know what are the current values for these options configured in my server? =

Access the System Info page using the menu Bulk WP -> System Info. The System info page displays the values for the different configuration options that are configured in your server.

= How do I disable different sections of the Plugin =

You can enable or disable different sections of the Plugin by choosing the required modules in the screen option. You can open screen options by clicking the link in the top right corner of the Plugin page.

= Is it possible to restore the posts that I have deleted through the Plugin?  =

If you choose the option "Move to trash" then you can find them from trash. But if you choose "Delete permanently", then it is not possible to retrieve the posts. So be **very careful**.

= Is it possible that some Plugin are not compatible with Bulk Delete? =

Yes. If a Plugin rewrites the query vars by using `add_filter( 'pre_get_posts' )` then it may be incompatible with this Plugin.

If you find any Plugin with which Bulk Delete doesn't work, then let me know and I will try to see if I can add support through some hack.

= Is it possible to schedule deletion of posts? =

The ability to schedule deletion of posts is available as a [pro addon](http://bulkwp.com/addons/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_campaign=BulkDelete&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=pro).

= I have a question about the pro addons, how should I contact you? =

You can contact us by posting about it in our [support forum](http://bulkwp.com/support/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_campaign=BulkDelete&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=support).
