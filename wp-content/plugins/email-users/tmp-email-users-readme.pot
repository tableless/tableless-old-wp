msgid "New in v4.5.0 is an action, <em>mailusers_update_custom_meta_filters</em>, which can be used to dynamically update Meta Filters before they're used for recipient selection or email address retrieval.  The example below leverages the Meta Key <em>Department</em> and its various values to define and update a new Meta Key called <em>publicworks</em>.  Anytime a Group Email is sent or Post/Page notification is initiated, this action will fire and rebuild the <em>publicworks</em> meta key based on the values of the <em>department</em> meta key.  This sort of action could be used to create more complex meta value relationships or to integrate other plugins."
