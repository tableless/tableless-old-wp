= How CleanTalk improves SEO for your website? =
So, you already know that the speed of the site has a direct impact on SEO.

*CleanTalk works faster than most of the other anti-spam plugins.* It is common knowledge that the faster your site loads, the better your customer experience is, the better your SEO will be, and the better your site will convert. Speed is becoming increasingly important in SEO, conversion and user experience. Today, site speed is one of the most important ranking factors on Google. A site that loads slowly will lose visitors and potential revenue.

There are different ways of improving your site's loading performance. One important parameter for site performance is to install well-developed plugins from a reputable source.

Among anti-spam plugins CleanTalk Anti-Spam is one of the fastest. Despite the large plug-in functionality, the developers have optimized the performance of the plugin so that CleanTalk is faster than most analogs. This contributes to the cloud service architecture, as all calculations take place in the cloud, not on the server, the server receives the finished result for further action.

https://s.w.org/plugins/cleantalk-spam-protect/screenshot-5.png?r=1288723

= How CleanTalk works? =
 * A visitor writes a comment or registers
 * CleanTalk plugin sends action parameters into the CleanTalk cloud
 * Service analyzes the parameters
 * If this is a visitor, the comment will be published. If it’s a spam bot, then CleanTalk blocks this comment or registration.
 * Parameters are written to the log which can be viewed in the Control Panel service.

The CleanTalk team has been developing cloud-based spam protection for 5 years and has created a truly reliable anti-spam service designed for you to ensure your safety.

= Spam attacks log = 
Service CleanTalk (this plugin is a client application for CleanTalk anti-spam service) records all filtered comments, registration and other spam attacks in the "Log of spam attacks" and stores the data in the log for up to 45 days. Using the log, you can ensure reliable protection of your website from spam and no false/positive filtering.

= SpamFireWall =
CleanTalk has an advanced option "SpamFireWall". This option allows blocking the most active spam bots before they get access to your website. It prevents 
spam bots from loading website pages so your web server doesn't have to perform all scripts on these pages. Also it prevents scanning of pages of the 
website by spam bots. Therefore SpamFireWall significantly reduces the load on your web server. 
SpamFireWall also makes CleanTalk the two-step protection from spam bots.
SpamFireWall is the first step and it blocks the most active spam bots. 
CleanTalk Anti-Spam is the second step and checks all other requests on the website in the moment of submitting comments/registers etc. 

= How SpamFireWall works? = 
 * The visitor enters to your web site.
 * HTTP request data is checked against the nearly 5.8 million identified IP spam bots.
 * If it is an active spam bot, the bot gets a blank page, if it is a visitor then they receive the site page. This is completely transparent to the visitors. 

All the CleanTalk SpamFireWall activity is being logged in the process of filtering.

= SpamFireWall DDoS Protection (Experimentally option) =
SpamFireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, SpamFireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. Your website gives the intruder a special page with description of DDoS rejection instead of the website pages. Therefore SpamFireWall can help to reduce CPU usage on your server.

= XML-RPC brute force protection = 
SpamFireWall can mitigate XML-RPC brute force attacks. It blocks XML-RPC attacks from bad IP addresses. This helps to prevent bruteforce attacks by a Remote Procedure Call.

= No spam comments, no spam registrations, no spam contact emails, no spam trackbacks. CAPTCHA-less anti-spam for WordPress =
Spam is one of the most irritating elements. Rates for spam increases every year and conventional anti-spam can no longer handle all the spam bots. CleanTalk prevents and automatically blocks spam. You'll be surprised how effective CleanTalk is in protecting against spam.

= How to protect sites from spam bots without CAPTCHA? =
The most popular method is CAPTCHA - the annoying picture with curved and sloping symbols, which are presented to the visitor to decipher and fill in. It is supposed that spam bots won't discern these CAPTCHA, but a visitor will. CAPTCHA provokes great irritation, but if the visitor wants to comment, he has to fill in these symbols time after time, making mistakes and starting once again. 
Sometimes CAPTCHA reminds us of the doodles of a two year old child. For users with vision problems CAPTCHA is an insurmountable obstacle. Users hate captcha. Captcha for users means "hate". Unreadable CAPTCHA stops about 80% of site visitors. After 2 failed attempts to decipher CAPTCHA 95% of visitors reject further attempts. At the sight of CAPTCHA and after input errors, many visitors leave the resource. Thus, CAPTCHA helps to protect the resource both from bots and visitors. CAPTCHA is not a panacea from spam. Doubts concerning the Need for CAPTCHA?

*“Ultimately, CAPTCHAs are useless for spam because they’re designed to tell you if someone is ‘human’ or not, but not whether something is spam or not.” Matt Mullenweg*

You do not have to work in IT to know what spam is. Besides piles of unwanted email, there are spam bots, or special software programs designed to act as human website visitors that post unwelcome messages over the Internet to advertise dubious services. More often than not spam messages do not even make sense. Similar to bacteria and virus mutations developing antibiotic resistance, spam bots are becoming more resilient in penetrating Internet firewalls and security layers. 

*Why are they spamming me?*

Spammers want to get backlinks from your site to improve their site's PageRank or redirect your visitors to malicious sites.This level of spam can damage your reputation with readers and commentators if you fail to tackle it. It is not uncommon for some WordPress websites to receive hundreds or even thousands of comments every week. However, by using a CleanTalk plugin, spam can be easily handled by your WordPress website.

= CleanTalk's features =
CleanTalk is one of the fastest plugins that allows you to lower the server load. One of the important parameters for each web master is the speed of the site, so we make sure that our plugin consumes as little as possible of server resources. Cloud service provides the advantage that all the checks take place in the cloud. 

CleanTalk has developed unique algorithms to assess visitor behavior. CleanTalk analyzes user behavior and parameters of completed forms. Our anti-spam module, installed on your website, sends the behavior parameters of either a visitor or spam bot. These parameters are estimated, and the CleanTalk service makes a decision – to post a message or to define it as spam and reject. On the basis of such checks, the service forms its own list of email addresses used by spam bots.

The registrations of visitors are checked in a similar manner. The service adds not only email addresses to the blacklist, but also IP addresses and domains of websites that are promoted through spam mailout. All of this happens automatically and requires no action from the administration of the website. At 2.5 million queries the service makes a mistake in 40-45 cases, i.e. CleanTalk detects spam with 99.9982% accuracy. We constantly monitor these errors and make adjustments to our algorithms, Even with this exceptional accuracy our team is aiming to improve figures over time. 

All-in-one. CleanTalk immediately protects all forms – comments, registration, feedback, contacts. No need to install additional plugins for each form. You save resources and increase performance of your website.

Spam attacks log. Service CleanTalk records all filtered comments, registration and other spam attacks in the “Log of spam attacks” and stores the data in the log for up to 45 days. Using the log, you can ensure reliable protection of your website from spam and experience no false/positive filtering. 

With the help of anti-spam by CleanTalk you can check existing comments and users, to find and quickly delete spam comments at once. This allows administrators of websites to automatically check and identify spam bots, comments and users, which were not detected by conventional anti-spam tools. Checking existing comments and users is made against a database of the nearly 2 million certain spam bots. Detailed statistic allows CleanTalk customers to control the whole process. 

CleanTalk has an advanced option “SpamFireWall”. This option allows you to block the most active spam bots before they get access to your website. It prevents website pages loading when attempted by by spam bots, so your web server doesn’t perform unnecessary scripts on these pages. Also it prevents scanning of website pages by spam bots. Subsequently SpamFireWall significantly reduces the load on your web server. SpamFireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, SpamFireWall will block requests from bad IP addresses. Your website gives the intruder a special page with a description of DDoS rejection instead of the website pages. SpamFireWall can help to reduce of CPU usage on your server for this reason.

1. Checks by Email, IP, domains at spam activities list. The plugin online use spam activity database at cleantalk.org, which are consist more then 1 billion records about spam activity IPs, Email, Domains and ASN. If the senders IP or Email matches with database, the sender gets some spam scores. To reduce false/positive rate the plugin doesn't use only blacklist test to ban spammers. The sender will be banned only if multiple spam test failed.

There are a few reasons for this:

* With the indexing of your web-site by the search systems, appearance of external links and better search results position, your web-site attracts more and more spambots.
* Non-transparent protection systems like CAPTCHA or question/answer, that don't have spam attacks statistics, don't let you see the whole picture, or the picture is incomplete.
* Counting methods for spam attacks and spam bots are different for different systems, which explains the diversity. We seek to provide detailed statistics.

The plugin has several options to detect spam bots and humans. If you just post spammy text like this,

    "I want to sell something", "Buy something here.." and etc

Yes, it does. CleanTalk works with any CDN system, i.e. CloudFlare, MaxCDN, Akamai.  

= Can I use CleanTalk functionality in my plugins? =
Yes, you can. Just use following snippet:

    <?php 
    if(!function_exists('ct_test_message')){
    	include_once( ABSPATH . '/wp-content/plugins/cleantalk-spam-protect/cleantalk.php' );
    }	
    //for registration test:
    $res=ct_test_registration("nickname", "stop_email@example.com", "127.0.0.1");
    //or for some other messages (contact forms, comments etc.)
    $res=ct_test_message("nickname", "stop_email@example.com", "127.0.0.1", "test message");


$res now contents array with two parameters:
  * $res['allow'] - is request allowed (1) or not (0)
  * $res['comment'] - comment for our server's decision.

= I see two loads of script cleantalk_nocache.js. Why are you use it? =
This scrupt is using for AJAX JavaScript checking. Different themes use different mechanisms of loading, so we use two method for loading our script. If you absolutely knows what are you doing, you can switch one of methods off be defining constants in your wp-config.php file:

    define('CLEANTALK_AJAX_USE_BUFFER', false); //false - don't use output buffering to include AJAX script, true - use it

or

	define('CLEANTALK_AJAX_USE_FOOTER_HEADER', false); //false - don't use wp_footer() and wp_header() for including AJAX script, true - use it

= Can I add exclusions for some pages of my site? =
Yes, you can. Add in your wp-config.php file, before defining database constants, this string:

	$cleantalk_url_exclusions = Array('url1', 'url2', 'url3');

Now, all pages containing strings 'url1', 'url2', or 'url3' will be excluded from anti-spam checking. Remember, that this option will be not applied in registrations and comment checking - they are always protected from spam.

= Can I exclude personal data from sending to CleanTalk servers? =
Yes, you can. Add in your wp-config.php file, before defining database constants, this string:

	$cleantalk_key_exclusions = Array('key1', 'key2', 'key3'); 

Now all fields in your submissions with keys named 'key1', 'key2' or 'key3' will be excluded from spam checking.

= How to test SpamFireWall? =
Use special IP 10.10.10.10 in URL to test SpamFireWall. For example,

    https://cleantalk.org/blog/?sfw_test_ip=10.10.10.10

= How can I enter access key in WPMU version? =
To set up global CleanTalk access key for all websites in WPMU, define constant in your wp-config.php file before defining database constants:

    define('CLEANTALK_ACCESS_KEY', 'place your key here');

Now, all subsites will have this access key.

= Why CleanTalk is faster and more reliable than stand-alone solutions? =
All anti-spam checks are held in the cloud and aren't loading the web server. The cloud solutions have a huge advantage since the parameters are compared with information from more 100,000 websites.

= I see in logs a lot of blocked messages with reason "Forbidden. Please enable JavaScript. Spam sender name." =
A lot of spam bots can't perform JavaScript code, so it is one of the important checks and most of the spam bots will be blocked with reason "Forbidden. Please enable JavaScript. Spam sender name." All browsers can perform JS code, so real visitors won't be blocked.

If you or someone from your visitors have error "Forbidden. Enable JavaScript." please check JavaScript support in your browser and do JavaScript test at this page https://cleantalk.org/checkout-javascript-support.

If you think that message was blocked wrong, let us know about it. Please submit a support request here https://cleantalk.org/my/support.

= Does the plugin work with Varnish? =
CleanTalk works with Varnish, it protects WordPress against spam, but by default the plugin generates a few cookies that uses to protect against spam bots it disables Varnish cache on pages with CleanTalk's cookies. To resolve issue with cache turn off option 'Set cookies' in plugin settings.

    WordPress console -> Settings -> CleanTalk -> Advanced settings

In that way plugin will protect WordPress comments, registrations and most of popular contact forms, but will not protect some of rarely used contact forms. 

= Does the anti-spam plugin work with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)? =
Yes, it does. But you have to turn off the option 'Use AJAX for JavaScript check' in Advanced settigns to be fully compatible with Accelerated Mobile Pages.
