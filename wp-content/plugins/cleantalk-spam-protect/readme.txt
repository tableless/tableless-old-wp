= How to protect sites from spam bots without CAPTCHA? =
The most popular method is CAPTCHA - the annoying picture with curved and sloping symbols, which are offered to the visitor to fill in. It is supposed that spam bots won't discern these CAPTCHA, but a visitor will. CAPTCHA provokes great irritation, but if one wants to speak out, he has to fill in these symbols time after time, making mistakes and starting once again. 
Sometimes CAPTCHA reminds doodle 2x year old child. For users with vision problems captcha is just an insurmountable obstacle. Users hate captcha. Captcha for users means "hate". Unreadable CAPTCHA stops about 80% of site visitors. After 2 failed attempts to bring it up to 95% reject further attempts. 
At the sight of CAPTCHA and after input errors, many visitors leave the resource. Thus, CAPTCHA helps to protect the resource both from bots and visitors. CAPTCHA is not a panacea from spam. Doubts Concerning the Need for CAPTCHA?

Multiple anti-spam tests helps avoid false/positive blocks for real website visitors even if one of tests failed.

= How does the plugin work with spam comments? =
Spam comments moves to SPAM folder or you can set option to silent ban spam comments.

= How does the plugin stop spam? =
Plugin uses several simple tests to stop spammers.

1. JavaScript anti-spam test. 99% spam bots doesn't have all JavaScript functions support. So, the plugin has code which can run normal visitor and can't run the spam bot.
1. Checks by Email, IP, domains at spam activities list. The plugin online use spam activity database at cleantalk.org, which are consist more then 1 billion records about spam activity IPs, Email, Domains and ASN. If the senders IP or Email matches with database, the sender gets some spam scores. To reduce false/positive rate the plugin doesn't use only blacklist test to ban spammers. The sender will be banned only if multiple spam test failed.
1. Comment submit time. Spam bots usually send post immediately after page load, because spam bots not really fill the web form, they are only send $_POST data to the blog. The normal visitor sends the data within several seconds or minutes.

= Will anti-spam protects my theme? =
Yes, it will. The Anti-spam by CleanTalk compatible with any WordPress themes.

= How can I test anti-spam protection? =
Please use email **stop_email@example.com** for comments, contacts or signups to see how the anti-spam protection works. Also you can see logs for last 7 days at <a href="http://cleantalk.org/my/show_requests">Control panel</a> or look at folder "Spam" for banned comments.

= Is the plugin effective against spam bots? =
Plugin Anti-spam by CleanTalk stops up to 99.998% of spam comments, spam signups (registrations), spam contact emails, spam subscriptions, spam bookings or spam orders.

= What about pingback, trackback spam? = 
Plugin by default pass pingbacks without any checks. All trackbacks will be blocked if the sender had spam activity.

= Can I use CleanTalk with Akismet? =
Sure, you can use CleanTalk with Akismet. In this case probably you will have bigger false/positive rate (when legitimate comments/signups denies), but you will have stronger antispam protection at website.

= Can I use CleanTalk to remove pending spam comments? =
Yes, you can. The plugin has option to test all pending comments via database of <a href="https://cleantalk.org/blacklists">spam active IP/Email</a>, finded spam comments plugin moves to Trash folder.

= How the plugin finds spam in pending comments or registered accounts? =
Plugin checks all not spam comments against blacklists database and show you senders that have spam activity on other websites.	
There is some differencies between blacklists database and API to protect against spam bots registrations/comments online. Blacklists show all history of spam activity, but our API (that used in spam tests) used another parameters, too: last day of activity, number of spam attacks during last days etc. This mechanisms help us to reduce number of false positivitie. So, there is nothing strange, if some emails/IPs will be not found by bulk comments/accounts test.

= Should I use another anti-spam tools (Captcha, reCaptcha and etc.)? =
CleanTalk stops up to 99.998% of spam bots, so you can disable other anti-spam plugins (especially CAPTCHA like anti-spam plugins). In some cases several anti-spam plugins can conflict, so it will be better use just one plugin.  

= Is the plugin WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible? =
The plugin is WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible. Each blog in multisite environment has individual anti-spam options for spam bots protection.

= After installation I noticed in the statistics that the number of spam attacks increased =
There are a few reasons for this:

* With the indexing of your web-site by the search systems, appearance of external links and better search results position, your web-site attracts more and more spambots.
* Non-transparent protection systems like CAPTCHA or question/answer, that don't have spam attacks statistics, don't let you see the whole picture, or the picture is incomplete.
* Counting methods for spam attacks and spam bots are different for different systems, which explains the diversity. We seek to provide detailed statistics.

= Why my dummy "spam" comment passed to the WordPress? =
The plugin has several options to detect spam bots and humans. If you just post spammy text like this,

    "I want to sell something", "Buy something here.." and etc

The comments will be passed, becuase the plugin detect sender as a human. So, use special email *stop_email@example.com* to test anti-spam or wait a few days to see how the plugin works. 

= Is it free or paid? =
The plugin is free. But the plugin uses CleanTalk cloud service to filter spam bots. You have to register an account and you have two weeks free trial to test anti-spam for comments, registrations, bookings, contacts or orders. When the trial (on CleanTalk account) is finished, you can renew the subscription for 1 year or deactivate anti-spam plugin.

= Can I use CleanTalk with cache plugins? =
Anti-spam by CleanTalk doesn't use static HTML code into templates, so all anti-spam functions works correctly with any WordPress cache plugins.

= Does the plugin protects against spam bots at forms with third-party services? =
Yes, it does. Plugin protects web-forms on your websites which are send data to third-party servers (like MailChimp). To enable this protection set option 'Protect external forms' in plugin settings. 

= Compatible with Cloudflare? = 
CleanTalk is fully compatible with CloudFlare. Service doesn't filter CloudFlares IP's (AS13335) over blacklists database, so in this way plugin/service filters spam bots uses other anti spam tests.

= Can I use CleanTalk functionality in my plugins? =
Yes, you can. Just use following snippet:

    <?php 
    if(!function_exists('ct_test_message')){
    	include_once( ABSPATH . '/wp-content/plugins/cleantalk-spam-protect/cleantalk.php' );
    }	
    //for registration test:
    $res=ct_test_registration("nickname", "stop_email@example.com", "127.0.0.1");
    //or for some other messages (contact forms, comments etc.)
    $res=ct_test_message("nickname", "stop_email@example.com", "127.0.0.1", "test message");


$res now contents array with two parameters:
  * $res['allow'] - is request allowed (1) or not (0)
  * $res['comment'] - comment for our server's decision.

= I see two loads of script cleantalk_nocache.js. Why are you use it? =
This scrupt is using for AJAX JavaScript checking. Different themes use different mechanisms of loading, so we use two method for loading our script. If you absolutely knows what are you doing, you can switch one of methods off be defining constants in your wp-config.php file:

    define('CLEANTALK_AJAX_USE_BUFFER', false); //false - don't use output buffering to include AJAX script, true - use it

or

	define('CLEANTALK_AJAX_USE_FOOTER_HEADER', false); //false - don't use wp_footer() and wp_header() for including AJAX script, true - use it

= Can I add exclusions for some pages of my site? =
Yes, you can. Add in your wp-config.php file, before defining database constants, this string:

	$cleantalk_url_exclusions = Array('url1', 'url2', 'url3');

Now, all pages containing strings 'url1', 'url2', or 'url3' will be excluded from anti-spam checking. Remember, that this option will be not applied in registrations and comment checking - they are always protected from spam.

= Can I exclude personal data from sending to CleanTalk servers? =
Yes, you can. Add in your wp-config.php file, before defining database constants, this string:

	$cleantalk_key_exclusions = Array('key1', 'key2', 'key3'); 

Now, all fields in your submissions with keys named 'key1', 'key2' or 'key3' will be excluded from spam checking.

= How to test Spam FireWall? =
Use special IP 10.10.10.10 in URL to test Spam FireWall. For example,

    https://cleantalk.org/blog/?sfw_test_ip=10.10.10.10

= Some thoughts about CAPTCHA =
186	The annoying picture with curved and sloping symbols, which are offered to the visitor to fill in. It is supposed that spam bots won’t discern these symbols, but a visitor will. CAPTCHA provokes great irritation, but if one wants to speak out, he has to fill in these symbols time after time, making mistakes and starting once again. At the sight of CAPTCHA and after input errors, many visitors leave the resource. Thus, CAPTCHA helps to protect the resource from visitors. Spam bots can automatically recognize Captcha. Spam bots can not pass through the anti-spam CleanTalk, complex invisible checks can immediately detect spam bots.
